**What kind of benchmark have you performed?**

e.g. what method have you used to develop PGS, what cohort have you evaluated?

**Does your benchmark follow a reference standardised approach?**

If you want to add a benchmark to this website it must follow a reference standardised approach to ensure the comparison is fair. Publicly available pipelines such as [GenoPred](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/pipeline_overview.html) and [prs-pipe](https://github.com/intervene-EU-H2020/prspipe) implement reference standardised approaches (Pain et al 2024, Monti et al 2024).

[See our documentation for a description of a reference standardised approach](https://methodscomparison.intervenegeneticscores.org/tutorials/guidance).

**Have your data been submitted to the PGS Catalog?**

We use the [PGS Catalog](https://www.pgscatalog.org/) [REST API](https://www.pgscatalog.org/rest/) to fetch effect size data for each evaluated method. For example, [PGP000517](https://www.pgscatalog.org/publication/PGP000517/).
