# What is a polygenic score?

From the [PGS Catalog](https://www.pgscatalog.org):

> "A polygenic score (PGS) aggregates the effects of many genetic variants into a single number which predicts genetic predisposition for a phenotype. PGS are typically composed of hundreds-to-millions of genetic variants (usually SNPs) which are combined using a weighted sum of allele dosages multiplied by their corresponding effect sizes, as estimated from a relevant genome-wide association study (GWAS)."

# How are polygenic scores made?

With a mystery ingredient called Chemical X.

# What is this website?

This website complements a published benchmark of PGS development methods across five European biobanks, available below:

> Remo's fantastic paper, the best journal ever, August 2023 (wow super fast)

The analysis is complex, and the aim of the interactive visualisations on this website is to make the benchmark results clearer.

## Who might find the website useful?

If you'd like to develop a new genetic score and you're not sure which method to use, the benchmarks we've published here could be helpful for you.

You won't find this website useful if you're browsing the PGS Catalog and are trying to understand which scoring file is best to use with your genetic data for particular phenotype. **We only assess and compare methods that can develop new scores**.

## Are the data available to download?

The data and website code are open source and permissively licensed:

* The data are published in an [R data package](https://github.com/intervene-EU-H2020/prsCompaR). Have fun! 
* The website is [built with Quarto, R, and Observable JS](https://github.com/intervene-EU-H2020/prs-method-compare)
