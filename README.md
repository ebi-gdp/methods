# pgs-method-compare

A website that describes the performance of PGS development methods across five European biobanks.

## Build notes

To build the website from source you'll need:

-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org) (tested with `v1.3.433`)
-   [R](https://www.r-project.org) (tested with `v4.3.1`)

And an R package:

-   [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) (tested with `v1.0`)

Then run:

```         
$ git clone https://github.com/intervene-EU-H2020/pgs-method-compare.git
$ cd pgs-method-compare/
$ R
> renv::restore() # installs dependencies
$ quarto preview # builds and opens website in your browser
```
